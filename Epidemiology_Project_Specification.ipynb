    "#### Background\n",
    "Epidemiological models are increasingly used during infectious disease outbreaks to make outbreak projections and to guide control interventions. This project involves developing simple computational models of outbreaks and using them to predict the effects of different interventions. It also involves using stochastic epidemiological models (models that include randomness) to predict the risk that early cases at the beginning of an outbreak lead on to a major epidemic (with a large number of cases) as opposed to fade out as a minor outbreak (with a small number of cases). \n",

    "If more details are required about the background epidemiological modelling theory, please rewatch the Epidemiology Lecture, available on the MA124 moodle page.\n",

    "#### Structure of project\n",
    "There are six tasks in the document below, tasks A1-A5 and then task B1. Your group should do all six of these tasks. Tasks A1-A5 are worth approximately 60% of the credit for this submission and task B1 is worth the rest (approximately 40%).\n",

    "- In each simulation, there will be 10 individuals infected initially (with the rest of the population susceptible).\n",
    "- The most challenging part of this task is that, in each simulation, events will occur at different times. As a result, we have to write code that, for each simulation, extracts the value of $I(t)$ at a set of pre-defined values of $t$. One way to do this is to set up a vector at the beginning of the simulation containing 201 blank entries (corresponding to $t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 100$), and then populate the relevant entries after each event (i.e. put the value of $I$ before the current event in all entries corresponding to times between the last event time and the current one). This vector can then be averaged across all simulations.\n",
    "- The code in the Python notebook entitled \"Epidemiology_Part_A4_with_Errors\" is a first attempt at writing such code (i.e. code that outputs a vector $I_{vals}$ with entries recording the values of $I$ at $t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 100$) for a single simulation of the stochastic SIR model, but it contains three mistakes. Correct this code (and then copy the resulting code into your answer to this task in this notebook).\n",
    "- Now that you have corrected the code described above, run 100 simulations of the stochastic SIR model and plot the average values of the vector $I_{vals}$, plotted at $t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 100$.\n",

    "**Assignment:** Using Python, write code to complete the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider the variable $M$, which represents the total number of individuals ever infected over the entire course of a simulation of the stochastic SIR model (run until $I$ hits zero) - i.e. the final value of $I + R$. Plot a graph of ${\\rm Prob}(M > m)$ as a function of $m$, for the default parameter values described in Task A5 above (compute the probability by running a large number of stochastic simulations and calculating the proportion of simulations in which $M>m$). Hint: You only have to run the simulations once (rather than running multiple simulations for each value of $m$).\n",
    "- Add a vertical line to the plot marking the value of $m$ that corresponds to the (positive) solution to the \"final size equation\" described in the Lecture (note: you will have to look up an appropriate Python function to solve this equation numerically, as in Task A2 above).\n",
    "- Now instead consider the stochastic SIS model described in the paper \"Will an outbreak exceed available resources for control? Estimating the risk from invading pathogens using practical definitions of a severe epidemic\" by Thompson, Gilligan and Cunniffe (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsif.2020.0690). The key difference between the stochastic SIR model and the stochastic SIS model is that, in the stochastic SIS model, individuals go back into the $S$ compartment when they recover (rather than entering the $R$ compartment). Pick either the \"Final size\" or \"Duration\" definition of a severe epidemic described in that paper, and write code to reproduce the relevant figure from that article using model simulations (either Fig 4a or Fig 4b; n.b. you are only required to reproduce the solid lines in the chosen figure). Hint: You do not have to simulate the model until $I$ hits zero to make this figure - that might take a very long time. Instead, you can stop each simulation as soon as the relevant maximum value on the x-axis is exceeded (or when $I$ hits zero, if that occurs first).\n",
    "- Most of this Assignment involved using deterministic and stochastic versions of the basic SIR model. However, the SIR model is quite simple and does not include some important features that affect transmission of pathogens in the real world. Do some research into ways that the SIR model can be extended to include additional real-world realism. Write one or two paragraphs to summarise your findings (including noting some pathogens/diseases for which the extensions that you explain are appropriate).\n",
